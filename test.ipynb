Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatestJediingalactic history.', \"The son ofJedi KnightAnakin SkywalkerandSenatorPadm√© Amidala, Luke Skywalker wasbornalong with histwinsister, Leia, in19 BBY. As a result of Amidala'sdeathand Anakin's fall to thedark side of the Force, the Skywalkerchildrenwere separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by theroyal familyofAlderaanwhile Luke was raised by hisrelativesonTatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways ofthe Forceunder the guidance of Jedi MasterObi-Wan Kenobi, whose firstapprenticewas Luke's ownfather. During theBattle of Yavinin0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire'splanet-killingsuperweapon, theDeath Star. He continued histrainingin theyearsthat followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor inGrand MasterYoda. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in theBattle of Endorin4 ABY, during which he confronted theSith LordDarthVader, whom helearnedwas in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to thelight side of the Forceby killing theEmperorandDark Lord of the SithDarth Sidiousat the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as theChosen One. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice onAjan Kloss, but Leia ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her knighthood.\", \"With theSith's destruction and the subsequentcapitulationof the Empire, Skywalker traveled across thegalaxyduringNew RepublicEra, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding theJedi Order. In9 ABY, SkywalkerrescuedGrogu, aMandalorianForce-sensitive child that belonged to the samespeciesas Yoda, fromMoffGideon'sforces, and after temporarily taking the child as an apprentice onOssus. During the training, Skywalker was visited by Anakin's former padawan,Ahsoka Tano, where they discussed Grogu and how Skywalker sensed that the child's heart was not in relearning the Jedi path. After Grogu's caregiver,Din Djarin, visited the planet bearing agiftfor Grogu, Skywalker offered him with a choice, accept the gift and return to the Mandalorian, or takeYoda's lightsaberand continue with his Jedi training.

In21 ABY, Skywalker started feeling an increasing darkness in the Force and having dark visions that frequently came to him in meditation and undertook aquest to findthe hidden world ofExegol.

Following this, Skywalker was able to defeatKizaand the spirit ofExim Panshardbut was ultimately unable to locate Exegol after failing totrack downanassassincalledOchi.\", \"In28 ABY, Skywalker, glimpsing the darkness in Solo, briefly contemplated killing him, causing Solo to fall to the dark side. Thedestructionof histempleand the deaths of all his students convinced a haunted and regretful Skywalker that thetimehad come for the Jedi to end. Skywalker therefore soughtexileon thedistantworld ofAhch-To, having elected to live out his remainingdaysas ahermitdespite the galaxy's pleas for help during theriseof theFirst Order. His solitude was interrupted in34 ABY, shortly after thefallof the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to playone last, momentous rolein the conflict between light and darkness. Although hepassed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order.
